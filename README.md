Script use-case: comparing IP addresses against IP addresses involved in security IOC.

This is a simple python script that will take in two CSVs and compare rows for matching IP addresses. Each CSV should not have a header. If a match is found, they will be listed. If a match is not found, a simple message will be returned.
